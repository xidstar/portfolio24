        I'm a creative developer with a keen focus on interactivity, motion
        design and building appealing web experiences. I believe in crafting web
        experiences that are not just functional but also captivating. With the
        added experience of working as a UI/UX developer, I've helped think tank
        experts build a web presence and hone their content, giving them an
        opportunity to connect with their audiences in clearer, more imaginative
        ways.
